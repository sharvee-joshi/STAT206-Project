# Replication and Extension: Instabilities of Regression Estimates Relating Air Pollution to Mortality

## Overview

This project replicates and extends the analyses presented in the article "Instabilities of Regression
Estimates Relating Air Pollution to Mortality". The original study investigates the sensitivity of
regression-based estimates when analyzing the relationship between air pollution and mortality,
focusing on the challenges of model specification and the stability of the results.

The goal of this project is to reproduce the findings from the paper while incorporating modern
techniques and fitting our own alternative model. Additionally, we aim to assess the robustness of
the methods used, and provide deeper insights into the factors
that contribute to the observed instabilities in regression estimates.
