# Replication Project: Instabilities of Regression Estimates Relating Air Pollution to Mortality

## Overview

This project replicates the analyses conducted in the article "Instabilities of Regression Estimates Relating Air Pollution to Mortality". The original study examines the sensitivity of regression-based estimates when analyzing the relationship between air pollution and mortality, highlighting challenges in model specification and stability.

The purpose of this project is to reproduce the results from the paper, assess the robustness of the methods used, and provide insights into the factors contributing to the observed instabilities in regression estimates.
